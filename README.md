# wikirace
Wiki race competition. A badly vibe-coded version. Rules are simple:

1. Select start entry and goal entry (links or random)
2. All participants join in
3. First one to reach goal entry wins!
4. The game is turn based, whenever a person clicks a link, everyone else has x seconds (as defined by creator) to select another link. Otherwise the system will pick one randomly from the wiki entry.
